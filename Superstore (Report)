# Superstore Profitability Analysis

##  Project Overview

This project explores the **Superstore dataset** to understand why profitability remains low despite strong sales. Using **SQL for data wrangling and exploratory analysis**, and **Power BI for visualization**, I identified key drivers of profit and loss, focusing on **discount practices, product performance, customer retention, and shipping efficiency**.

---

##  Workflow

1. **Data Preparation (SQL)**

   * Imported the dataset into PostgreSQL.
   * Checked for **null values**, **duplicates**, and **invalid ranges** (e.g., discount > 1).
   * Engineered new columns:

     * `profit_margin = profit / sales`
     * `shipping_duration = ship_date – order_date`
     * Extracted `year, month, quarter, weekday` for time analysis.

    Result: Clean dataset ready for analysis.

## 📊 Insights & Findings

### 1. Sales vs Profitability

Even with **\$2.30M in total sales**, overall profit is only **\$286.4K** (margin ≈ **12%**).

| Metric            | Value     |
| ----------------- | --------- |
| Total Sales       | \$2.30M   |
| Total Profit      | \$286.40K |
| Profit Margin (%) | 12%       |

### 2. Impact of Discounts

* Analysis showed a **negative correlation** between discounts and profit (`corr = -0.22`).
* High discount levels (>40%) often resulted in **loss-making orders**.

📉 *Visualization:*

* Discount vs Profit scatter (from dashboard):

### 3. Unprofitable Products

Certain products consistently generated **negative profit**, dragging down margins.

| Product Name                                      | Total Profit (\$) |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 3.6 Cubic Foot Counter Height Office Refrigerator | -872.08           |
| 3D Systems Cube Printer, 2nd Gen                  | -468.00           |
| Acco Premium Plus Surge Suppressor                | -113.77           |
| Acco D-Ring Binder w/ DublLock                    | -102.84           |

⚠️ These products are **revenue drivers but not profit contributors**.

### 4. Profitability by Region & State

* Profitable: **California, New York, Washington, Michigan**.
* Loss-making: **Texas, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania**.

📊 *Visualization:*
Profit by State (segmented by region):

### 5. Customer Retention

* Only **\~30% of customers return** after their first order.
* However, retained customers generate **higher lifetime sales and profit**.

| Metric                        | Value |
| ----------------------------- | ----- |
| Retention Rate (%)            | \~30% |
| Avg Revenue per Customer (\$) | 1,893 |
| Avg Profit per Customer (\$)  | 236   |

---

### 6. Shipping Efficiency

* **Standard Class**: most cost-effective.
* **First-Class & Same-Day**: higher cost, not always translating into profit.
* Late shipments (>5 days) correlate with **lower average profit per order**.

| Ship Mode      | Avg Delivery Days | Orders | Avg Profit (\$) |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------ | --------------- |
| Standard Class | 4.7               | 5,000+ | 35.2            |
| First Class    | 2.2               | 1,200  | 18.6            |
| Same Day       | 0.9               | 900    | 10.2            |
